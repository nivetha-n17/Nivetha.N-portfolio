::about
I'm a **developer** and **art director** based in Nice (France). I'm passionate about coding, design, and everything in between.

With over **7 years** of experience in the web industry, I have been working on a wide range of projects, from small websites to complex web applications.
I recently start my **OSS (Open-Source) journey** turning all my projects public.

Through open-source, I'm able to share my knowledge and experience with the community, and contribute to the growth of the ecosystem.
